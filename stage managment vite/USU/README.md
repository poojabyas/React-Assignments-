Code 1 Analysis
Asynchronous Nature of setCount: React's setCount is asynchronous, so console.log(count) executes before the state update, displaying the older count.
Solution: Use useEffect with count as a dependency to log the updated count value after state update.






Code 2 Analysis
Count Value Not Updated to 3: setCount calls are asynchronous, so multiple calls in handleClick batch updates, resulting in the same old value.
Approach: Use functional form of setCount with a callback to update based on previous state, ensuring count becomes 3.
